## üîß Flutter Fundamentals

### 1. Stateless vs Stateful Widgets

* **StatelessWidget**:

  * Immutable.
  * UI doesn't depend on state changes.
  * Rebuilds only when parent changes.
  * Example: Static content like splash screen or about page.

* **StatefulWidget**:

  * Mutable via `State` class.
  * UI depends on dynamic data (user input, timers).
  * Lifecycle methods available: `initState`, `didUpdateWidget`, `dispose`.
  * Example: Form inputs, toggles, dynamic content.

**Choose based on dynamicity of content and interaction requirements.**

---

### 2. Keys

* **Purpose**: Retain widget identity across rebuilds.
* **Types**:

  * `Key` (base), `ValueKey`, `ObjectKey`, `UniqueKey`, `GlobalKey`.

**Use Cases**:

* Optimizing ListView performance.
* Maintaining state during item reordering.
* `GlobalKey` for accessing widget state (e.g., forms).

---

### 3. Extension Methods

* **Add new functionality to existing classes** without subclassing.

```dart
extension CapExtension on String {
  String capitalize() => this[0].toUpperCase() + substring(1);
}
```

* **Benefits**:

  * Improves readability.
  * Keeps utility functions near relevant types.

---

### 4. `isMounted`

* Property in `State` objects to check if widget is in tree.
* **Avoids**: `setState() called after dispose()` exception.
* **Best Practice**: Check `if (mounted)` before calling `setState` in async callbacks.

---

### 5. Localization (`l10n`)

* **Tools**: `flutter_localizations`, `intl`, `.arb` files.
* **Command**: `flutter gen-l10n`
* **Pluralization**: Use `Intl.plural(...)`

**Challenges**:

* Keeping .arb files in sync.
* Misnamed keys or malformed JSON.

## ‚öñÔ∏è State Management

### Approaches:

| Approach     | Pros                                  | Cons                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Provider** | Simple, official, great for beginners | Not scalable alone            |
| **Riverpod** | Compile-safe, declarative, testable   | Learning curve                |
| **BLoC**     | Structured, scalable, widely used     | Boilerplate-heavy             |
| **Redux**    | Predictable, unidirectional           | Verbose, outdated for Flutter |

**Decision Factors**:

* Team experience
* App complexity
* Developer familiarity

**For junior teams**: Prefer Provider or Riverpod.
**Avoid**: BLoC/Redux unless training is given.

**When to avoid your preferred method?**

* When team lacks experience with it.
* When rapid prototyping is needed.
* If debugging complexity outweighs benefits.

## üé® UI/UX Design

### Responsive Layouts

* `LayoutBuilder`, `MediaQuery`, `FractionallySizedBox`, `Flexible`.
* `flutter_screenutil`, `responsive_builder`, `sizer`.
* Adaptive layouts for tablets and phones.

### Animations

* **Implicit**: `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`
* **Explicit**: `AnimationController`, `Tween`, `AnimationBuilder`
* **Transitions**: `PageRouteBuilder`, `Hero`, `FadeTransition`, `SlideTransition`
* **Debug Performance**: DevTools timeline, `TickerMode`, frame budget awareness.

---

## üîå API Integration

### Networking

* **Libraries**: `http`, `Dio`, `Chopper`
* **Layering**:

  * Data Layer (API services)
  * Domain Layer (Use Cases)
  * Presentation Layer (Widgets/BLoC)
* **Error Handling**: Dio interceptors, sealed result classes

---

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Strategies:

* Use `const` widgets where possible.
* Avoid rebuilding large trees unnecessarily.
* Use `RepaintBoundary` to isolate re-renders.
* Debounce/throttle user input.

### Detection:

* Use `Flutter DevTools` (Rebuild profiler, Timeline).
* Check widget rebuilds with `debugPrintBuild()`.

### Startup Time:

* Minimize `initState` work.
* Use deferred loading for heavy widgets.
* Optimize asset loading.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Flutter Architecture

### InheritedWidget

* Low-level dependency injection.
* Used by `Provider`, `Theme.of()`, `MediaQuery.of()`.
* Used when child widgets need access to ancestor data.

### Patterns Used:

* **MVVM**: With Provider or Riverpod.
* **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven separation.
* **MVC**: Rare in modern Flutter.

### Modularization

* Feature-first or layer-based packages.
* Shared module for design system/constants.
* Handle dependencies using DI frameworks.

### Navigation

* **Navigator 1.0**: Imperative.
* **Navigator 2.0**: Declarative (used by `go_router`).
* **go\_router**:

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(path: '/home', builder: (context, state) => HomePage()),
  ],
);
```

* Benefits: Deep linking, guards, declarative structure.

---

## ‚è≥ Async Programming

### Dart Constructs:

* `Future`: For one-time async results.
* `Stream`: For multiple async events (like WebSockets).
* `FutureBuilder`, `StreamBuilder`: For UI binding.

---

## üì± Native Integration

* **MethodChannels**: Bridge between Dart and platform code.
* **PlatformView**: Embed native views.
* **FFI**: For native C/C++ interop.
* **Challenges**: Permissions, testing, maintenance.

---

## ‚ùå Error Handling

* Wrap async code in `try/catch`.
* Use `Either` / `Result` types for functional error propagation.
* Show errors with `SnackBar`, `Dialogs`, or error screens.

---

## üß™ Dependency Injection

### Tools:

* **GetIt**: Service locator.
* **Provider**: Scoped injection.
* **Riverpod**: Declarative, better scoping and testing.

### Scoped DI:

* Provide different instances using `MultiProvider`, `ScopedProvider`.
* Example: AuthService at root, user-specific service deeper.

### Refactoring for DI:

* Extract dependencies to constructor params.
* Replace singletons with injectable services.
* Test by mocking dependencies.

---

## üåç Localization & Accessibility

* **Localization**: `.arb` files, `flutter_localizations`, `intl`.

## üîç Flutter Architecture & Framework

* **State Management Decisions**:

  * Use Provider for simple state needs and for teams newer to Flutter.
  * Use Riverpod for safe, modular, testable, and scalable apps.
  * BLoC is suitable for enterprise-grade apps requiring strict state separation.
  * Avoid Redux unless working with developers familiar with web/state mutation debugging.
  * In junior teams, prefer Provider or Riverpod to reduce complexity.

* **Dependency Injection (DI)**:

  * Prefer `get_it` for simple service locator pattern.
  * Use Riverpod's `ProviderScope` for context-aware DI.
  * Handle scoped dependencies with nested providers or DI containers.
  * Testing is easier when using dependency injection‚Äîmock services in tests easily.
  * To refactor legacy code: extract services from constructors and centralize logic into injectable classes.

* **Performance Optimization**:

  * Use `const` constructors.
  * Avoid unnecessary rebuilds by breaking widgets down and using `shouldRebuild` and `ValueKey`s.
  * Use DevTools, track jank frames, and diagnose layout overdraws.
  * Place expensive widgets in `RepaintBoundary`.
  * Profile build methods that re-run too often.

* **Animations**:
